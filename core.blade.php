						<p class="animate-onscroll">The programs and initiatives of SEAMOLEC are carried out based on the principles of Collaboration, Accountability, Responsiveness and relevance, Effectiveness and efficiency, and Synergy. <br><br>

Collaboration has been articulated into knowledge-based working team across division, also actualized into networking, inter-center collaboration, and joint programs/initiatives with other institutions. The principle of accountability is closely related to the accountability of the effectiveness and efficiency of activities in achieving goals or target of policies or programs that have been set. Custom designed programs and new initiatives as responses to the changing needs and new challenges have been encouraged to increase responsiveness and relevance of the Centre's services to the clients/partners. Harmonious synergy in various aspects is also required in order to improve the Centre performance in achieving long-term goals.</p>
