						<p class="animate-onscroll">To accomplish the vision, mission, goal, and objectives, SEAMOLEC will hold the functions of training, research and development, information, consulting, and resource linking on any aspect of open and distance learning. The intention for SEAMOLEC is that it will be a specialist in open and distance learning organization/institution, and not in conflict with other SEAMEO Centers. There are seven functions proposed by the study team to all SEAMEO member countries to be reviewed. The seven functions of SEAMOLEC could be accepted. The comments the study team received from the member countries was on activities for each function. The functions are as follows: <p>

								<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-2 col-sm-4">
								
								<ul class="list finger-list">
									<li>To provide training in the development and practice of open and distance learning systems.</li>
									<li>To conduct needs assessment, research and evaluation on open and distance learning, and educational technology.</li>
									<li>To disseminate information on open and distance learning and on the use of technology to make learning more effective.</li>
									<li>To foster collaborative arrangements and links between regional/national agencies and between the Center and external open and distance learning.</li>
									<li>To facilitate inter-institutional open and distance learning courseware acquisition, exchange, development and adaptation in the region.</li>
									<li>To promote sharing and exchanges of expertise and other resources for the improvement of the quality in open and distance learning.</li>
